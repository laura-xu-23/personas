                <h2>Brown University Mail Pick-Up Kiosk</h2>

            <div class="body-wrapper">
                <h4 class="text">The Brown Mail Pick-Up Kiosk allows Brown students to easily pick up their packages and 
                    mail sent to their mailbox in Page-Robinson Hall. The touch-screen interface prompts 
                    users to type in their Brown ID or swipe their physical Brown ID card. Users have the option 
                    to pick up their mail either now or later. The kiosk simplifies the mail pick-up process, as 
                    students need only to swipe their ID card to determine which packages have arrived to pick up.

                <h4>
                    After observing Brown students filter in through the sliding doors of Page-Robinson and using the mail
                    pick-up kiosk, here are some initial observations:
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li class="list">All users swiped their ID card instead of typing in their Brown ID</li>
                    <li class="list">All users used the mail kiosk outside the mailroom instead of the screen interface inside the mailroom</li>
                    <li class="list">All users selected the “Pick Up Now” option and proceeded into the mailroom</li>
                    <li class="list">Most users did not have to wait in line to swipe their ID</li>
                    <li class="list">Some users swiped their ID card up and down multiple times</li>
                    <li class="list">One user swiped their Brown ID and the search bar was filled with a few dots. 
                        This was an indication that they did not swipe their ID card properly. 
                        They flipped it over and swiped it again and yet again it did not process. 
                        They walked to the other screen and successfully swiped their ID card</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>
                    Additionally, I prepared some user research questions to ask select Brown students about their experience with the
                    mail pick-up interface:
                </h4>
                <ol>
                    <li class="list">If you had never seen the interface before, how would you go about using the mail pick-up kiosk?</li>
                    <li class="list">What do you expect to happen if you swipe your Brown ID?</li>
                    <li class="list">What alternative method would you use to perform this task?</li>
                    <li class="list">Was anything surprising or did not perform as expected?</li>
                    <li class="list">Was the interface easy to understand?</li>
                    <li class="list">If you could change one thing about the design, what would it be?</li>
                </ol>
